# Privacy Policy for YouTube Farsi Translator

**Last updated:** December 2024

## Overview

YouTube Farsi Translator is a browser extension that translates YouTube English subtitles to Persian/Farsi language. This privacy policy explains how we handle information in relation to our extension.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be completely transparent: **YouTube Farsi Translator does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or user data.**

Specifically, we do not collect:
- Personal information (name, email, address, phone number)
- Browsing history or web activity
- Video viewing habits or preferences
- Location data
- Financial information
- Authentication credentials
- Any form of user analytics or tracking data

## Local Data Storage

The extension uses your browser's local storage only to:
- Save your API keys (stored locally on your device only)
- Remember your subtitle display preferences (position, visibility settings)
- Cache translated subtitles to avoid re-translation (stored locally only)

**Important:** All data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.

## Third-Party Services

The extension integrates with external translation services:

### OpenRouter API
- When you choose to use OpenRouter for translation, subtitle text is sent to OpenRouter's servers for translation
- This data transmission only occurs when you actively request translation
- Please refer to [OpenRouter's Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy) for their data handling practices

### Gemini API
- When you choose to use Google's Gemini for translation, subtitle text is sent to Google's servers for translation
- This data transmission only occurs when you actively request translation
- Please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for their data handling practices

### Font Loading
- The extension loads the Vazir Persian font from jsDelivr CDN for proper Persian text display
- This is a standard web font loading practice and does not involve data collection

## User Control

You have complete control over:
- Which translation service to use (or not use the extension at all)
- Your API keys (stored locally, can be deleted anytime)
- All extension settings and preferences
- Cached translation data (can be cleared through browser settings)

## Data Security

Since we don't collect or transmit personal data:
- There are no user databases to be breached
- Your API keys are stored securely in your browser's local storage
- No user accounts or registration required

## Children's Privacy

Our extension does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated "Last updated" date.
